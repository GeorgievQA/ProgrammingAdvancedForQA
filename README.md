# ProgrammingAdvancedForQA

Welcome to my GitHub repository for my student project in advanced C# programming for QA. In this repository, I will be sharing the tasks and projects assigned during my online university course. This space serves as a record of my learning journey and a showcase of the skills I am developing in C#.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or reach out if you have any questions. I appreciate your interest in my work!
